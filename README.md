# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
This project implements a real-time emotion recognition system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It leverages OpenCV for video capture and face detection, along with the DeepFace library for emotion analysis. The system identifies and classifies emotions expressed by individuals captured through a webcam.
